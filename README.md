This repository contains the implementation and experimental evaluation of the Bees Algorithm applied to polynomial and spline regression models.

Project Summary
Nature-inspired optimisation techniques can help find optimal parameters in regression
models where standard methods struggle due to complex solution spaces.

In this project, I implemented:
- Polynomial and spline regression models
- Custom optimisation using three different fitness metrics:
  - Mean-Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean-Squared Error (RMSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Key Objectives
- Implement Bees Algorithm from scratch in Python
- Apply it to regression problems
- Measure performance and error convergence
- Compare parameter optimisation across models

Contents
- Polynomial regression benchmarks (log, sin, tan)
- Separate fitness function implementations
- Parameter sensitivity experiments

Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Academic Context
This work forms part of an Post Graduate Dip. dissertation submitted to the University of Birmingham for the Post Graduate Diploma Advanced Engineering Management (Project Management).
