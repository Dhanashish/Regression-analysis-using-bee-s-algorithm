Regression Analysis using the Bees Algorithm

This repository contains the implementation and experimental evaluation of the Bees Algorithm applied to polynomial and spline regression models.

Project Overview
The Bees Algorithm, a nature-inspired optimization technique, is used to optimise regression model parameters by minimising error metrics such as:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Contents
- Polynomial regression benchmarks (log, sin, tan)
- Spline regression benchmarks
- Separate fitness function implementations
- Parameter sensitivity experiments

Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Academic Context
This work forms part of an Post Graduate Dip. dissertation submitted to the University of Birmingham for the Post Graduate Diploma Advanced Engineering Management (Project Management).
